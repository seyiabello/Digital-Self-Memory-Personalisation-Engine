    "- **Self-retrieval artifact:** If the system retrieves the memory it just stored, similarity can be artificially perfect (distance ≈ 0.0).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Expected behavior in other modes (reproducible)\n",
    "- **no_memory:** no long-term persistence; preferences will not be retrieved via LTM; personalization only comes from immediate instructions in the current turn.\n",
    "- **stm:** short-lived continuity within recent turns only; memory decays; no semantic recall of older preferences.\n"
